## Folder **Figure_2** contains

1. data for Fig 2(a) and Fig 2(c) left panel ("TimeSeries_Vill55_alpha0.mat")

This file contains the matrix "S_rec" of size 692x6, which corresponds to time series data for single simulation on the village network 55 for the case alpha = 0. The 6 columns correspond to: (1) time t (2) number of susceptible agents at time t (3) number of infected agents at time t (4) number of recovered agents at time t (5) number of vaccinated agents at time t (6) cumulative number of infected agents at time t.

2. data for Fig 2(b) and Fig 2(c) right panel ("TimeSeries_Vill55_alpha1.mat")

This file contains the matrix "S_rec" of size 924x6, which corresponds to time series data for single simulation on the village network 55 for the case alpha = 0. The 6 columns correspond to: (1) time t (2) number of susceptible agents at time t (3) number of infected agents at time t (4) number of recovered agents at time t (5) number of vaccinated agents at time t (6) cumulative number of infected agents at time t.

3. data for Fig 2(d) and Fig 2(e) (Folder "vill55_network")

This folder contains files for simulations on the village network 55 for the cases alpha = 0 and alpha = 1. The file names are "vill55_qX_alphaY.mat" where X is the value of \beta and Y is the value of alpha (0 or 1). Each .mat file contains a matrix "datavn" of size 2x1000.

The 6 columns correspond to: (1) time t (2) number of susceptible agents at time t (3) number of infected agents at time t (4) number of recovered agents at time t (5) number of vaccinated agents at time t (6) cumulative number of infected agents at time t.

2. data for Fig 3(a) right panel ("TimeSeries_ER_alpha1.mat")

This file contains the matrix "S_rec" of size 1103x6, which corresponds to time series data for single simulation on an ER network of size 1024 for the case alpha = 1. The 6 columns correspond to: (1) time t (2) number of susceptible agents at time t (3) number of infected agents at time t (4) number of recovered agents at time t (5) number of vaccinated agents at time t (6) cumulative number of infected agents at time t.

3. data for Fig 3(b) and Fig 3(c) (folder "ER_network")

This folder contains files for simulations on ER networks of size 1024 for the case of local information (alpha = 0, "loc_.mat") and global information (alpha = 1, "glo_.mat").

This contains data for inf_\infty and vac_\infty for one value of \beta, for 1000 simulation runs.

4. data for Fig 3(d) (folder "Kavg_ERN_KVN")

This folder contains files for simulations on ER networks of size 1024 as well as on empirical village networks.

For the case of ER networks, the file names are "glsp_qX_kY_alphaZ.mat", where X is the value of \beta, Y is the average degree of the network used and Z is the value of alpha (0 or 1). Each .mat file contains a matrix "dataq" of size 2x1000. This contains data for inf_\infty and vac_\infty for one value of \beta, for 1000 simulation runs.

For the case of village networks, the file names are "villX_qY_alphaZ.mat", where X is the village id, Y is the value of \beta and Z is the value of alpha (0 or 1). Each .mat file contains a matrix "datavn" of size 2x1000. This contains data for inf_\infty and vac_\infty for one value of \beta, for 1000 simulation runs.

The file names are "Xn_alphaY_qZ.mat", where X is the multiple of 1024 that specifies the system size (e.g. X="02" corresponds to a network of size 2x1024) and Y is the value of alpha (0 or 1) and Z is the value of \beta. Each .mat file contains a matrix "dataq" of size 2x1000. This contains data for inf_\infty and vac_\infty for one value of \beta, for 1000 simulation runs.

2. data for Fig 4(b) and Fig 4(c) (folder "ER_16N")
